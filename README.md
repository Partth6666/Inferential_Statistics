# Problem-I
The Student News Service at (CMSU) has decided to gather data about the 
undergraduate students that attend CMSU. CMSU creates and distributes a survey of 14 questions and 
receives responses from 62 undergraduates (stored in the Survey data set).
# Problem-II
An important quality characteristic used by the manufacturers of ABC asphalt shingles is the amount of 
moisture the shingles contain when they are packaged. Customers may feel that they have purchased a 
product lacking in quality if they find moisture and wet shingles inside the packaging. In some cases, 
excessive moisture can cause the granules attached to the shingles for texture and colouring purposes to 
fall off the shingles resulting in appearance problems. To monitor the amount of moisture present, the 
company conducts moisture tests. A shingle is weighed and then dried. The shingle is then reweighed and 
based on the amount of moisture taken out of the product, the pounds of moisture per 100 square feet is 
calculated. The company would like to show that the mean moisture content is less than 0.35 pounds per 
100 square feet. 
Based on the above context, the manufacturer wants to understand the following: 
1. Is there any evidence that the mean moisture content in both types of shingles is within the 
permissible limits? 
2. Is the population mean for shingles A and B are equal?
# Problem-III
Salary is hypothesized to depend on educational qualification and occupation. To understand the 
dependency, the salaries of 40 individuals are collected and each person’s educational qualification and 
occupation are noted. Educational qualification is at three levels, High school graduate, Bachelor's, and 
Doctorate. Occupation is at four levels, Administrative and clerical, Sales, Professional or specialty, and 
Executive or managerial. A different number of observations are in each level of education–occupation 
combination.
Based on the above context, we want to understand the following: 
1. Is there any significant difference in salaries among different levels of education? 
2. Is there any significant difference in salaries among different levels of different occupations? 
3. Is there a significant interaction between Education and Occupation on Salary?
